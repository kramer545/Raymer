If you want to move around in the scene, you will need to add an FPS controller.  You can you use the one included in the standard assets.
In the Unity editor, go to Assets < Import Package < Characters, and import all the assets.
In the project window, go to Assets < Standard Assets < Characters < FirstPersonCharacter < Prefabs , and coose the FPSController and add it to the scenea at 0,0,0.
If you want to add a texture to the terrain, you import the Environment assets (Assets < Import Package < Environment), click on 'terrain' in the heirarchy,
click the paint texture icon in the inspector, click 'edit textures', then 'add texture', and choose a texture from the list.
